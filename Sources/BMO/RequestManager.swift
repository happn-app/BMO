 * BMO means "Backed Managed Objects"
 * Other names considered:
 *    AMO (Asynchronous Managed Objects) <-- Actually a better name than BMO, but we love BMO!
 *    CADF (Custom Async Db Front)
 *    ACDC (Async Core Data Front)
 *    Core Data Cache for Backing Store
 *    BSF (Backing Store Front)
 *    FLCAIS (FL Custom Async Incremental Store (historic name))
 *
 *
 * BMO is a concept. Any Db Object can be a BMO.
 *
 * When saving a Db context through a BMORequestManager, the manager will query
 * its backing store to save the changes detected in the Db context.
 * Similarly, when executing a Db fetch request through the BMO manager, the
 * request will be executed synchronously first, then the manager will contact
 * its backing store to retrieve new object if applicable. The retrieved objects
 * will be inserted in the Db context and the client will be called
 * asynchronously to be notified of the update.
 *
 * This principle historically comes from Apple documentation about the
 * incremental data store. In theory, with incremental data stores, one should
 * be able to hook Core Data to a WebService (so they say). In practice, this
 * would be done using a separate Core Data stack to store the results of
 * previous requests from the WebService. When a fetch request is done on such a
 * stack, the incremental store would first query its private stack, and return
 * the results directly. Just before that, it would have launched a web
 * operation. When the operation finishes, it will send a notification so that
 * concerned clients can re-fetch their data (if possible blocking the creation
 * of a web operation to avoid infinite requests to the backing store…).
 * Even though it's not very practical, this solution _could_, at a first
 * glance, work. However, in practice, this solution is **not** compatible with
 * NSFetchedResultsController. (When the web operation finishes, the private CD
 * stack is updated, but the client context has no notification to be informed
 * of the changes. Re-fetching the new objects won't trigger the required
 * notifications for the fetched results controller to be aware new objects are
 * available in the context! Even refreshing the objects (which is in itself an
 * expensive operation) does not work if I recall correctly…)
 * After some thinking, I came up with the FLCAISRequestManager, which is the
 * ancestor of the BMORequestManager.
 * FYI, here is an implementation of the original “async incremental store” (the
 * project has been archived):
